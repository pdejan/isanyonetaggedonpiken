Small one page application made purely for fun and entertainment in MMORPG game Guild Wars 2. It uses GW2 API to determine which servers are paired with my own sevrer (Piken Square) in an weekly WvW matchup. Then it will randomly pick one of available and correctly accessible waypoints for user to teleport to in an attempt to fool around with people who constantly type "where's the commander/action happening".
